I studied videography and later photography. I studied to be an entrepreneur and marketing expert. It wasn\u2019t until I was 22 years old that I decided to leave other projects and focus on my startup and photography journey. During my studies I continued taking photos and presenting my work to several competitions at GuruShots and in the future in exhibitions.<\/p>\n<p>Motorsposrt photography at Tesla Motors, as I understood it at that time really fit me. It wasn\u2019t a very strict and low risk kind of photography, the standards were not too conventional and bending the rules wasn\u2019t almost impossible. Even though my first impressions were too positive there was still something about them that really caught my eye and convinced me that I could do something different with a little bit more of risk.<\/p>\n<p>During my experience being a photographer I learned that I must be different to really shot epic photos. Be different.<\/p>\n<p>I consider myself as an enthusiast and outgoing guy, sharing my time with others is very important to me.com 80% of my life is social and photography time, because I love to travel, but I also like to lie on a beach and watch the clouds with my music on my AirPods. I feel very fortunate to be doing what I love for a living.<\/p>\n<p>One more thing, Air Details LLC is the official commercial name of Pencil Works LLC, Pencil Works LLC and Air Details LLC are the same company.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for visiting my site,<br \/>\nI know your time is important.<br \/>\nMiguel[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] Bio [\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;30&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_rounded&#8221; onclick=&#8221;custom_link&#8221; img_link_target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; link=&#8221;instagram.com\/miguelgargallo.es&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]Miguel Gargallo is the CEO of Pencil&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"csco_singular_sidebar":"","csco_page_header_type":"","csco_appearance_grid":"","csco_page_load_nextpost":"","csco_post_video_location":[],"csco_post_video_location_hash":"","csco_post_video_url":"","csco_post_video_bg_start_time":0,"csco_post_video_bg_end_time":0},"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/27"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=27"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/27\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32,"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/27\/revisions\/32"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/airdetails.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=27"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
